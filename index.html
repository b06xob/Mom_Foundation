		  <h1>Welcome To The MOM Foundation</h1> 
          <p>Mothers are God's helpers preparing the way for future generations through prayer and faith.
 
 &#34Near the cross of Jesus stood His mother, Mary, His mother&#39s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw His mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to her, &#34Woman, here is your son,&#34 and to the disciple, &#34Here is your mother.&#34 From that time on, this disciple took her into his home. (John 19:25-27) 
&#34Even to your old age I will be the same, and even to your graying years I will bear you! I have done it, and I will carry you; and I will bear you and I will deliver you.&#34 (Isaiah 46:4)

		    <p>After reading the two bible verses above, my mind started thinking about how special you Mothers really are to God! How even at His son&#39s feet at the cross, God recognized Jesus&#39 mother, by allowing Jesus to put emphasis on His mother and the one disciple. Jesus went on to let them both know that, Mary this is your son, and to the disciple whom He loved, this is your mother. You see, Jesus was planting a seed; and that seed was a mother and a son. Maybe this disciple didn&#39t have a mother; and, maybe Mary thought she would be alone without a child. But, at the Cross, Jesus took time to tell them both who they were to each other. Right in the middle of death, the God we serve took care of business. And at the end it states the disciple took Mary into his home. Isn&#39t it good to know that even when you think you are alone God will still take care of you through His son Jesus? Whether you have children or not, married, single, or widowed, Jesus will take care of you! Sometimes, Jesus sees far ahead into the future before we can begin to know what&#39s going to happen in our lives. So, when you think there is not any help for you, believe what Jesus said is true, and take Him at His word, because God will do just what He said, and that is take care of you. Sometimes children don&#39t want you, and will not communicate with you and leave you alone; sometimes the husband, relatives, and friends will do the same thing. But, guess who you are living for? You are living for the Heavenly Father, the one who knows all and will see about all. </p>
